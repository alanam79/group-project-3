  # PawedCaster

  ## Description
  We are a group of software developers with a passion for podcasts and animals. We created this app for users that want to discover a wide variety of pet & animal related podcasts, while also being able to directly support our furry, scaly, and feathery friends. PawedCaster creatively monetizes user traffic and ad space to contribute the proceeds directly to local animal shelters, rescues, and ASPCA chapters. We hope you find what you are looking for while exploring the possibilities.
